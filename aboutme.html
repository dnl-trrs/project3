  <ul>
  <li>I'm a musician who plays guitar and drums</li>
  <li>I'm a "YouTuber" that's been making videos since 2016</li>
  <li>I have recently become interested in live streaming again</li>
  <li>Most of my videos are related to things I work on in my personal time and I share it to my channel, its a bit of a diary</li>
  <li>If I didn't major in ITM, I would've majored in Audio Engineering or looked into Community College, Certifications, and maybe some form of religious studies.</li>
  <li>Audio Engineering was something I was interested in as a creative person musically and visually but I've always been strong in the technical aspects of things relating to the technology used for creative work.</li>
  <li>I wasn't going to apply to college and just go straight to community college but after doing FAFSA and doing early applications to a handful of school I was offered enough money that I'd be a fool to pass on it.</li>
  </ul>
